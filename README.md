Check out of git. From the command line, run the sbt, or sbt.bat if on windows. You should now be in a sbt console. Run 'Complile'. That should download all of the necessary libraries. You should see it report success. Next run 'container:start', it should show that it's a local server to demo the appication. In your web browser, goto "http://localhost:8080/" you should from there be able to try out the appication.
